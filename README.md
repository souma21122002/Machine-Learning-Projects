# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects. This README file specifically covers the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Diabetes dataset.

## EDA on Diabetes Dataset

The EDA notebook aims to analyze the Diabetes dataset to extract meaningful insights and visualize the data distributions and relationships.

### Introduction

The `EDA_On_Diabates_Dataset.ipynb` notebook performs an exploratory data analysis on the Diabetes dataset. The primary goal is to understand the distribution and relationships of various features in the dataset, which will help in building predictive models later.

### Usage

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/souma21122002/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
   cd Machine-Learning-Projects
